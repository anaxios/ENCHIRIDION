The fathers teach us by example that we should not be ready to expose others sins and in fact we should cover their sins and pray for their repentance.

One example is the abba in the Saying of he Desert fathers when a brother was accused by his brethern of having a woman in his cell. Even though the brother was committing this scadalous sin the abba still sat on the barrell where the woman was hidded so the brother could come to repentance without the scorn and judgement from the other brothers.

Another example is from St. Macarios, he and a novice were walking a long distance to go to a feast day celebration and the novice ran ahead and met a pagan priest along the way. The novice derided and condemned the priest for his evil practices and the pagan priest beat him to death. A while later Abba Macarios met the priest on the road and greeted him, "man of God" (as the translation puts it) and asked the priest why he was so upset and with only those kind words the pagan priest was converted and became a monk.

The sins commited by the brother in the first story and the pagan priest in the second were very great sins, but we can see the difference between how the judging brothers and the overly zealous novice treated these sinners and how the holy men treated them.

The scripture says that we will be judged by how we judge others. We will be judge very harshly by God because of the hatred and grudges we hold against those we think are lesser than we are. Why do we so readily judge others and have no compassion for their faults? It's because we don't see ourselves trulyâ€”we have built up egos for ourselves. We forget that we are very far from God. We make excuses to justify our hatred toward others, thinking that our own sins will be overlooked but our neighbors sins will condemn them.

[[St Maximos the Confessor]] says in the [[Philokalia]],

> If we detect any trace of hatred in our hearts against any man whatsoever for committing any fault, we are utterly estranged from love for God, since love for God absolutely precludes us from hating any man. . . .Blessed is he who can love all men equally.

God has not given us too heavy a burden whe he tells us to forgive the sins of others and to cover their sins and leave the judgement to him. The heavy burden is our pride and ego.
